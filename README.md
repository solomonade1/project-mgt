# Project Management App

### Full-Stack Application

This repository contains a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, React.js, and Apollo Client.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure with separate directories for the backend and frontend:

- Root Directory: Contains the main package.json file and is the entry point for the application.
- server: Directory containing backend files, including routes, controllers, models, and GraphQL schema.
- client: Directory containing the React.js frontend application. It has its own package.json and all necessary frontend files and folders.


## Technologies Used
### Backend
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js used for handling HTTP requests and routes.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- GraphQL: Query language for APIs used for efficient data fetching and manipulation.
- Apollo Server: GraphQL server implementation used for serving GraphQL queries.


## Frontend
- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Apollo Client: GraphQL client used for making queries and managing application state.
- React Router: Library for handling routing in the React application.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies for the backend
